## Theory

---

### Authentication vs Authorization

--

*"Who are you and what are you allowed to do?"*

--

#### Authentication

- Verifying that someone is who they claim to be.
- *Who are you?*

--

#### Authorization

- Verifying which resources a user can access and what they are allowed to do with those resources.
- *What are you allowed to do?*

--

#### Single Sign-On (SSO)

- Allows a user to enter one set of credentials in order to access multiple applications.

<img src="images/sign_up_with_google.png" style="max-width:30%;padding-top:20px;padding-left:30px;" alt="sign up with google">

---

### What is OAuth?

--

[Oauth](http://oauth.net) is an open standard for authorization.

*"An open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications."*

--

It's all about delegation:

--

1. The *Client* application accesses resources, from a *Resource Server*, on behalf of the *User*.
1. The *User* does not have to share their credentials with the *Client*.

--

<br>

**Compared to OAuth 1.0, Oauth 2.0:**

- Is slightly simpler to implement
- Adds time to live (TTL) to the Access Tokens
- Supports mobile and desktop apps
- No longer requires client applications to have cryptography

---

### Terminology

--

| Term                 | Definition                                                                                                                      |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Resource Owner (aka User) | End user who authorizes an application to access their account                                                             |
| Client (aka Consumer)     | Application that accesses protected resources on behalf of the user                                                        |
| Authorization Server | Server which grants Access Tokens after the user authorizes the application                                                     |
| Resource Server      | Restricted resource / API                                                                                                       |
| Access Token         | Token used to access restricted resources                                                                                       |
| Authorization Code   | Intermediate token returned to the client, after the user authorization step, which the client exchanges it for an access token |
| Grant                | Method of acquiring an access token                                                                                             |

---

### Grant Types

--

| Grant Type                 | Use Case                    | Link                                                           |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Authorization Code         | Server-side web apps        | [section 4.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1) |
| Implicit                   | Single Page Apps (SPAs)     | [section 4.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2) |
| Resource Owner Credentials | Trusted first party clients | [section 4.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3) |
| Client Credentials         | Machine-to-machine          | [section 4.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4) |

--

#### Questions

--

- **Which grant should you use?** [Decision tree](images/oauth-grants.svg)

--

- **First vs third party client?**

    - First party clients are clients that you trust. For example, Twitter *probably* trusts the Twitter iPhone app since they own it.
    - Third party clients are clients that you don't trust.

--

- **Access Token Owner?** Do you not need the user's permission to access the restricted resources?

---

### Authorization Code Flow

--

<br>

**[Step 1]** *Client* redirects the *Resource Owner* to the *Authorization Server*

<img src="images/oauth-flow-step1.png" style="padding-left:30px;" alt="oauth flow step 1">

--

<br>

**[Step 2]** *Resource Owner* grants authorization

**[Step 3]** *Authorization Server* redirects the *Resource Owner* back to the *Client* with an *Authorization Code*

<img src="images/oauth-flow-step2-step3.png" style="padding-left:30px;" alt="oauth flow step 2 and 3">

---

### Authorization Code Flow (continued...)

--

**[Step 4]** *Client* exchanges *Authorization Code* for *Access Token*

<img src="images/oauth-flow-step4.png" style="padding-left:30px;" alt="oauth flow step 4">

--

<br>

**[Step 5]** *Authorization Server* grants *Access Token*

<img src="images/oauth-flow-step5.png" style="padding-left:30px;" alt="oauth flow step 5">

---

### Authorization Code Flow (continued...)

--

<br>

**[Step 6]** *Client* uses the *Access Token* to access protected resources, from the *Resource Server*, on behalf of the *Resource Owner*

<img src="images/oauth-flow.png" style="padding-left:30px;" alt="oauth flow">

--

<br>

What's different about this flow for the other grant types&mdash;Implicit, Resource Owner Credentials, Client Credentials?

---

### History of OAuth

--

#### Before OAuth

--

The User would provide their credentials directly to the Client app.

--

##### Problems

1. Client stores User's password (one more application with your password)
1. Client gets complete access to the User's account (scope)
1. User cannot revoke access to the Client unless they reset their password

--

#### [Oauth 1.0](https://oauth.net/core/1.0/)

--

Introduced in December 2017 to prevent the Client application from having to directly handle the User's credentials.

--

##### Problems

1. Difficult to implement
1. Complex cryptographic requirements
1. Poor support for native desktop and mobile apps

---

### History of OAuth (continued...)

--

#### [Oauth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/)

First came out in April 2010.

--

##### Problems

1. Still difficult to implement
1. Difficult for the User to update the scope
1. Security concerns

## Practice

---

### What are we building?

--

#### Day 1

- We'll build an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server with Node, Express, and Postgres that uses the Authorization Code grant type.

<p style="margin:0"><img src="images/node-logo.png" alt="node logo" style="max-width:10%;padding-left:40px;"></p>

--

#### Day 2

- We'll add OpenID Connect to the existing server.
- Then, we'll create a separate Client application that can authorize against the Authorization Server.

--

#### Prerequisites

You should:

1. Have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) (v11.12.0), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6.7.0), [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) (v9.6+), and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.
1. Be familiar with Javascript syntax and fundamentals.
1. Have a basic understanding of the Unix command line.
1. Be able to build a RESTful API with Node, Express, and Postgres.

---

### Getting Started

--

Clone down the [node-oauth-server](https://github.com/mjhea0/node-oauth-server) repo, and then check out the `base` tag to the master branch:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mjhea0/node-oauth-server
$ git checkout tags/base -b master
```

--

Install the dependencies:

```sh
$ npm install
```

--

Run the server:

```sh
$ npm start
```

Ensure the server is up and running at [http://localhost:3001/](http://localhost:3001/) and [http://localhost:3001/ping](http://localhost:3001/ping).

--

<br>

Let's review *app.js* together...

---

### Structure

--

#### Authorize Endpoints

--

`/authorize` - GET

1. Query params - Grant type, client ID, redirect URI, user ID
1. Force log in
1. Verify the Client application along with the redirect URI
1. Verify user
1. Render template with authorize dialog

--

`/authorize/dialog` - GET

1. Display authorize dialog

--

`/authorize/dialog` - POST

1. If authorized, generate Authorization Code and redirect user to the redirect URI
1. If not authorized, send back an error

---

### Structure (continued...)

--

#### Token Endpoint

--

`/token` - POST

1. Payload - Grant type, Authorization Code, client ID, redirect URI
1. Verify Authorization Code (exists, has not expired, has not been consumed)
1. Verify the Client application along with the redirect URI
1. Respond with the Access Token, the Refresh Token (optional), and how long the token is good for


#### User Endpoint

--

`/userinfo` - GET

1. Query params - Access Token
1. Verify Access Token (exists, has not expired)
1. If valid, send back `true`
1. If not valid, send back `false`

---

### Structure (continued...)

--

#### Models

--

1. `user` - user ID, email, client ID, scope (optional)
1. `client` - name, redirect URI
1. `authCode` - code, created at, consumed, client ID, user ID, redirect URI
1. `accessToken` - token, created at, expires in, token type (e.g., bearer), consumed, user ID, refresh token (optional)

--

### Bearer Token

--

[Bearer Tokens](https://oauth.net/2/bearer-tokens/) are *probably* the most popular type of Access Token. They must be unique, nonsequential, and nonguessable.

--

[Using Bearer Tokens](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2):

1. Authorization Request Header Field: `Authorization: Bearer 4ae6ce68-4c59-4313-94e2-fcc2932cf5ca.`
1. Form-Encoded Body Parameter: `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `access_token=mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM`
1. URI Query Parameter: `resource?access_token=mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM`

---

### Implementation

--

So, we need to implement the following:

1. Models: `user`, `client`, `authCode`, `accessToken`
1. Routes: `/authorize` (GET), `/authorize/dialog` (GET and POST), `/token` (POST), `/userinfo` (GET)

--

> Let's "fake" user log in for now and get something working.

--

Where do we begin?

---

### Homework

1. Finish the Node Authentication Server
1. Read [User Authentication with OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/articles/authentication/) and [Understanding OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect](https://blog.runscope.com/posts/understanding-oauth-2-and-openid-connect)

---

## Theory

---

### Day 1 Review

--

- What's the difference between authentication and authorization?

--

- What is OAuth?

--

- Describe the various OAuth 2.0 grant types

--

- How does the grant type affect the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow?

<br>
<br>

ü§î

---

### What is OpenID Connect?

--

[OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/2014/02/26/the-openid-foundation-launches-the-openid-connect-standard/) (or OIDC), the latest version of OpenID, is a standard for authentication, issued by the [OpenID Foundation](https://openid.net/foundation/) in February 2014.
--

#### How does OpenID Connect work with OAuth 2.0?

--

- OpenID Connect extends OAuth 2.0, adding an extra layer for handling user authentication. It's a superset of OAuth 2.0.

--

- With OpenID Connect, the `token` endpoint returns an ID Token along with the Access Token.

--

- The ID Token is a [JSON Web Token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) that contains information about the authenticated user.

---

### JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

--

A JSON Web Token (or JWT) is a cryptographically signed Base64-encoded JSON object.

--

##### Benefits

- **Stateless**: Since tokens contain the required info to verify a user's identity, scaling is easier as you do not have to maintain a session store.
- **Single Sign On**: After a token is generated, you can have your users access a variety of resources without having to re-authenticate them.

--

##### Drawbacks

- **Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks**: Storing tokens in either local or session storage can lead to XSS attacks. Because of this, it's a good idea to store them in a cookie with `httpOnly` and secure flags.

--

---

class: center, middle

## Practice

---

### Adding OpenID

#### Steps

- Add `scope` to the `/authorize` endpoint

--

- Create (via [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken)) then return an `id_token` in the `/token` endpoint

--

- Modify the `/userinfo` to decode the ID Token and return user info

--

#### Questions

--

- What are [JWT Claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token)?

--

- Which Claims do you want to use in this example?

--

#### Security Recommendations

- Always use HTTPS!

--

- Issue short lived bearer tokens

--

- Don't pass bearer token in page URLs

---

### Client Application

--

Let's spin up a new Express application to serve as the Client.

--

#### Functionality

- Display "Authorize" button on page load to `/`

--

- On button click, redirect User (with Grant type, client ID, redirect URI, user ID, and Scope) to the Authorization Server's `/authorize` endpoint

--

- If the User authorization is successful, the User is redirect back to the client, to the redirect URI, with the Authorization Code

--

- With the Authorization Code in hand, request Access Token

--

- If the Authorization Code is valid, an Access Token + ID Token are sent back

--

- Store Access Token + ID Token

--

- On requests to restricted resources, send the Access Token + ID Token
