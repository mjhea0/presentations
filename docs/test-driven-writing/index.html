## Theory

---

### What is Test-Driven Development?

--

[Test-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD) is a methodology in software development that focuses on an iterative development cycle where the emphasis is placed on writing test cases before the actual feature or function is written.

- code, verify, repeat
- design, validate, repeat

--

#### TDD

1. Utilizes repetition of a short development cycle
1. Combines building and testing
1. Helps ensure correctness of code - but also helps to indirectly evolve the design and architecture of the project at hand.

---

### Red-Green-Refactor

--

TDD usually follows the "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle:

![tdd](images/tdd.png)

--

1. It can be slower in the short-term, but it, more often than not, improves the quality of the software project in the long run.

--

1. Having adequate test coverage acts as a safeguard so you don't accidentally change the functionality.

--

1. Finally, test suites can encapsulate the expectations of your software project so that your project's stakeholders (current self, future self, everyone else) can better understand the project.

---

### Questions

--

#### (1) What is Test-Driven Development?


--

#### (2) Can the Test-Driven model be applied to writing?

- Is there a way that you can write "tests" beforehand that tell you what to write and what not to write?
- Can you "encapsulate" the expectations of your tutorial so that your readers can better understand it?
- Will tests help to strengthen you thesis?
- Can you make a strong, upfront case that your readers can easily assert against?

### Test-Driven Writing

--

![tdd](images/test-driven-writing.png)

--

The goals are different:

1. You SHOULD NOT always adhere to the Test-Driven process! The Test-Driven model can constrain the artistic side when practiced rigidly. Constrains can be good at times, though. They can help you stay focused and keep you within scope.
1. You CANNOT fully test out your writing. ([Watson API](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/natural-language-understanding/)?)

---

### Test-Driven Writing Process

--

Start with:

1. Audience
1. Article type
1. Objectives
1. Narrative
1. Outline
1. Conclusion

As you write out each section from the outline, look back to the audience, objectives, and narrative to ensure you are staying on track.
